# Like in any other language python also has datatypes
# Datatypes can be broadly classified as primitive and non-primitive datatypes
# Primitive Datatypes
    # Number => Immutable
    # String => Immutable
    # Boolean => Immutable
# Non-primitive dataypes
    # List => Mutable
    # Tuple => Immutable
    # Dictionary => Mutable
    # Set => Mutable
 
# There is also a concept of Mutable and Immutable datatypes in Python
# Those datattypes which can be changed even after their creation are
# mutable datatypes

# Those datatypes which can't be changed after their creation are immutable
# types
